  base.cond = NULL,

\arguments{
\item{input_data}{a phyloseq object}

\item{cond.var}{the variable representing the conditions to compare, a character string}

\item{base.cond}{the condition chosen as baseline. This is only used when the condition is categorical.}

\item{adj.var}{the names of the variables to be adjusted, a vector of character strings}

\item{censor}{the value to censor at for zero counts, default 1}

\item{prev.filter}{taxa whose prevalences are smaller than the cutoff will be excluded from analysis, default 0.05}

\item{depth.filter}{a sample would be discarded if its library size is smaller than the threshold}

\item{alpha}{the cutoff of the adjusted p values}
}
\value{
a DAresult type object contains the input and the output. Use summary and plot to explore the output
